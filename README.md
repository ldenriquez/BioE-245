# BioE-245
**Machine Learning in Computational Biology (Spring 2020)**
*University of California, Berkeley*

A series of labs that conduct fundamental machine learning applications utilized in computational biology and bioinformatics.

**Lab 2:** Writes a verison of the Expectation Maximization algorithm to conduct DNA motif finding.

**Lab 3:** Determines the practical distributions of the basis for a dataset of RNA sequences in various conditions.

**Lab 4:** Uses a dataset of gene expression for 20 samples and performs k-means clustering and PCA.

**Lab 5:** Implements a linear regressor using gradient descent upon a dataset of RNA sequences to update the parameters and determine the optimal solution.

**Lab 6:** Classifies cell images from thin blood smear slides of segmented cells, with labels indicating the presence of malaria using Keras.

**Lab 7:** Analyzes gene expression of 20 samples, determining patterns in the dataset using principal component analysis, k-means implementation, and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and visualization
